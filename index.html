            <p>
                Hi! I’m Talia.
                <br>
                I received my degree at the Art Institute of Charlotte, I’m a passionate graphic designer looking to
                become a member of an innovative and productive design team. I’m looking to find a place where quality,
                collaboration and creativity co-exist.
                <br>
                I have 8 years of Environmental Graphic Design experience. I create concepts, develop proofs and layout
                print-ready files for clients with existing brands. I have experience managing production and
                fabrication teams, within tight timelines, in order to meet our client’s needs. Through my environmental
                design work, I have also attained meaningful experience with the following: Visual identity design,
                Marketing and Advertising design, Publication design, Presentation Design and Art and Illustration
                design.
